In 1895, Japanese people in British Columbia were denied the right to vote, regardless of where they were born. Racism was a widely accepted response to the unknown during this time, and ultimately substantiated the relegation of minorities to a lower position based on a presumption of moral inferiority. In the year 1900, naturalised Canadian citizen Tomekichi Homma requests to be added to the voter's list. Although the Collector of Voters refuses to recognise his name, a British Columbia judge rules that the clause excluding Asians from voting is unconstitutional (beyond the power of the Legislature).

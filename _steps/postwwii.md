1944, August 4th. Prime Minister King states that it is favourable to disperse Japanese Canadians across Canada, noting the applications for “voluntary repatriation” to Japan under the guise to prove loyalty to Canada.

On January 1st, 1946, the War Measures Act expired, only to be replaced by the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act to keep the measures against Japanese Canadians in place, proving injustice as an opportunity despite the end of a war.
On May 31st, the initial deportation of Japanese Canadians commenced, being approved as legal by the Supreme Court Decision later in December. Only by 1947 on January 24th, that deportation orders have been cancelled, despite 4,000 Japanese Canadians that have already been “repatriated.”
In April 1947, The Citizenship Act extended to Canadians of Chinese and South Asian origin but had excluded Japanese Canadians and Aboriginal peoples. Even more so, on July 18th, the Bird Commission was formed to inquire about losses through theft of property by the Custodian of Enemy Alien Property.
Finally, on March 31, 1949, restrictions under the War Measures Act were lifted, and freedom for Japanese Canadians was set in stone. This is the last of the WWII restrictions to be lifted.

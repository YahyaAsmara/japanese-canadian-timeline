From 1938 to 1940, Canadian officials are said to have maintained a close eye on Japan. On January 7th, 1941, there was widespread anti-Japanese sentiment in Canada, prompting the Cabinet War Committee to urge that volunteers for the armed forces be barred. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police fingerprinted and registered all Japanese Canadians over the age of 16 who were obliged to carry identification cards until 1949 from March to August, or the Spring of 1941, before World War II broke out.

On December 7th, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Shortly after, Canada declares war on Japan, enabling the War Measures Act, registering Japanese nationals into the Registrar of Enemy Aliens. Shortly after, on December 16th, 1941, the War Measures Act registered all peoples of Japanese origin, regardless of citizenship, to the Registrar of Enemy Aliens.

On February 7th, 1942, all able-bodied men regarded as “enemy aliens” above 18 were forced to work in road camps in the Rockies, which ultimately ruled by PC 1486 on February 24th, in which the Minister of Justice would have the ability to control the movement of Japanese Canadians. The Order In Council PC 1486, ordered the evacuation of all "persons of Japanese racial origin" and gave the RCMP the ability to search without a warrant, impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and seize cars, radios, guns, and cameras. The Custodian of Enemy Alien Property afterwards sold off the confiscated cars picked up at Hastings Park at discount prices. This led to the ordering of all Japanese Canadians to leave the west coast through the notice on February 26th, 1942, causing further discussion of exiling, expulsion and deportation of Japanese Canadians.

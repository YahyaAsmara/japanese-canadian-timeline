Also known as The Early Years of Japanese Canadian history. Manzo Nagano is the first known Japanese immigrant to Canada, arriving in 1877. In Victoria, British Columbia, he opens a gift shop, a Japanese food store, and a motel. Between 1877 and 1907, the issei men were the first generation of Japanese to immigrate and establish in Canada. The majority of Japanese women arrived after 1908. Japanese Canadians, like other minorities in Canada, had to fight prejudice to achieve status. The majority of them came from Japanese fishing villages and farms to Vancouver, Victoria, and the neighbouring areas. Others decided to settle in farming areas in the Fraser Valley, as well as fishing communities, mining towns, sawmill towns, and pulp mill towns along the Pacific coast.

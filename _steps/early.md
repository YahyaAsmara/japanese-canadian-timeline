Also known as The Early Years of Japanese Canadian history. Manzo Nagano, the first known Japanese immigrant to Canada, arrived in 1877. Japanese Canadians, like other minorities, had to fight prejudice and earn a respected position in the Canadian mosaic through hard work and determination. The majority of issei (ees-say), or first-generation immigrants, arrived in the first decade of the twentieth century. They arrived in Vancouver, Victoria, and the surrounding cities from fishing communities and farms in Japan. Others chose to live on farms in the Fraser Valley and in fishing communities, mining towns, sawmill towns, and pulp mill towns along the Pacific coast. The early migrants were single men, but they were soon joined by young women who began to form families.

In "Little Tokyo," a jeweler's shop is an example of one type of business. Powell Street becomes the Japanese Canadian community's social and commercial hub. Along the areas close to Hastings Mill, particularly along Powell Street, Issei (Japanese immigrants) build stores, boarding homes, and other businesses. Until World War II, this neighbourhood is home to the majority of Japanese Canadians.

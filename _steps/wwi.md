The start of World War I. Following their rejection in British Columbia, roughly 200 issei volunteers move to Alberta to join battalions of the Canadian expeditionary force, which is then dispatched to Europe to fight for Canada in World War I. In the following years, The Trades and Labour Congress of Canada accepts the Japanese Labour Union as a member. Yasutaro Yamaga founded the Maple Ridge Berry Growers Co-operative Exchange, the first agricultural producers' cooperative. Lastly, in 1931, surviving issei World War I veterans are granted the right to vote, making them the only Japanese Canadians to do so.

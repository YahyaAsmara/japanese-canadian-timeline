A vocal anti-Asian element in BC society attempted everything it could to force the issei to leave the country. A protest demonstration planned by the Anti-Asian League devolves into a riot on September 9th, 1907. The white mob rioted in Vancouver's Chinese and Japanese districts, claiming that Asian employees were endangering their livelihood. They petitioned the federal government to put a stop to Asian immigration, and thus the prejudices were institutionalized in legislation. Many businesses in "Little Tokyo" were vandalized and damaged.

Asians were denied the right to vote, were barred from most professions, including the public service and education, and were paid far less than whites. The Deputy Minister of Labour, William Lyon Mackenzie King, oversees a Royal Commission that analyses the merchants' claims for damages. In response, traders in Japan received $9,000 in compensation.

In 1984, the council meeting of the National Association of Japanese Canadians in Winnipeg unanimously approved resolutions seeking official acknowledgement and retribution for the atrocities perpetrated against Japanese Canadians during and after WWII, prompting redress efforts to form a proper reconciliation and a satisfying conclusion on all sides.

The Redress Agreement is signed by Prime Minister Mulroney and Art Miki, President of the National Association of Japanese Canadians, on September 22, 1988. Survivors of wartime events are compensated and told that "the forceful removal and imprisonment of Japanese Canadians during World War II, as well as their deportation and expulsion after the war, was wrong."

In additament to the apology, the government promised $21,000 to each person directly impacted and affected by the internment, the establishment of a community fund, pardons for those unjustly imprisoned during the war, and Canadian citizenship for Japanese Canadians and their descendants who were unlawfully repatriated to Japan at the end of the war. Lastly, the agreement set aside $24 million for the creation of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, whose mission is to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination in Canada.

"I know that I speak for Members on all sides of the House today in offering to Japanese Canadians the formal and sincere apology of this Parliament for those past injustices against them, against their families, and against their heritage, and our solemn commitment and undertaking to Canadians of every origin that such violations will never again in this country be countenanced or repeated." - Prime Minister Mulroney.

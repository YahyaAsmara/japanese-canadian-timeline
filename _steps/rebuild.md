The Bird Commission awards approximately $1.2 million in 1950, but rejects the National Japanese Canadian Citizens' Association's request for additional claims and an indemnity for general losses. PC 4364 becomes an Order-in-Council that revokes an order forbidding the immigration of "enemy aliens" and allows some of those who have been deported to re-immigrate to Canada.
The government of Canada announces a point system for incoming immigrants in 1967. "Race" is no longer a factor in immigration decisions.
The centennial of Japanese Canadians is being commemorated around the country. Redress is being discussed unofficially.

Communities are rebuilt and revived, just like "Little Tokyo." Despite this however, nothing can replace the damages and theft done.
